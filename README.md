## PolyGalaxian
Arcade Game JavaScript Remake

Just thought I'd create a simple game that somewhat resembles the 8-bit game Galaxian.  
I know, there's a lot of differences. Meh, doesn't really matter, as long as I get to play it.

"PolyGalaxian" is just "Polygon" and "Galaxian" combined. But honestly, if you manage to come up with a better name, please tell me and I'll consider changing it.

Things being worked on:
* More enemy types
 * Asteroids
 * And maybe a boss
* More weapons
 * **LASERS!!!**
* Powerups
* Better GUI
* Better controls (Space to shoot or click to shoot? Or both?)
* Fancy _(citation needed)_ particle effects
* Background?

Once the game is somewhat playable, I'll edit it to index.html so that it will be accessible on [Github Pages](http://charcoding.github.io/PolyGalaxian).  
I'll work on it if I have time (school is a thing, you know?).

Feedbacks and suggestions are welcome! :D
